# phishtrap
This goal of this project is to trap all the phishing mails used to scam people.
We collect all the domains listed from misp website that lists out all the phishing websites and respective domain names.
We also collect gmail logs from the user and map it to the phishing data.
Once we get a match, we raise an alert to the user.
